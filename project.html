<h3> So why were they breaking into the headquarters? What were they after? And who were they working for? </h3>
    <td>It was on June 17th, 1972, when five men broke into the Democratic headquarters where they photographed campaign documents and attempted to tap into the phone lines of important people helping with the Democratic party. On the night of the invasion, all the individuals involved in the break-in were arrested at the Watergate office complex. The thought of this invasion was to help give the republican party some insight into what the Democratic party had planned.  </td>

<h3> So why was President Nixon believed to be involved with this scandal? </h3>
    <td> Nixon had just begun his second term as President when this scandal unfolded. It was also an election year, which means the president was under a great deal of pressure. President Nixon and his election committee thought they could gain a major advantage in the election if they could receive private information regarding the democratic party. Their hopes were to recover critical pieces of information that would be used against the republican party in the upcoming election. Once the investigation began, they later found a $25,000 cashier check marked for Nixonâ€™s campaign program that ended up in the burglar's bank account before the invasion.

<h3> What happened to President Nixon? </h3>
    <td>On August 8th, 1974, President Nixon announced his resignation due to the ongoing investigation regarding the Watergate scandal.  Following President Nixons resignation, he was at the lowest point of his life. He underwent many hospitilizations due to stress and depression. Nixon then decided to accept his loss and learn how to recover financially. He decided to go on  multiple TV shows which made him millions. He also baught and sold realestate in his hometown, Florida.  </td>
