                Filters: temporary search
                Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated
                Two popular search techniques:
                Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time
                Binary search:
                only works if data is SORTED first
                start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc. </td>
